Oriel â€” UI upgrade branch: upgrade/ui-iterative-10

This branch contains a new React + Vite frontend (web/) with a glassmorphism design system, a small Express backend (src/server.ts) with demo-mode and SQLite persistence, Storybook, and CI. See web/README.md for frontend instructions.

Important: set environment variables for real LLM providers before using production iterate endpoint. Demo mode runs without secrets.
